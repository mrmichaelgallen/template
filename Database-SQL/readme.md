### Database and SQL Course Work
***

This is a collection of my course work at The Tech Academy on databases and SQL, both step by step drill work and some of my own solutions.

If you would like to see only my own solutions to software challenges, please check out my [portfolio](LinkToYourPortfolioHere) of my work with readme files detailing how I solved each one.
