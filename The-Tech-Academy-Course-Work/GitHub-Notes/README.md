#### Things to Remember
* Git is one type of version control software that tracks the versions of files, there are many! Read more about them on Wiki.
* While Git can create files, it's primary purpose is tracking them and allowing you to revert to prior versions if necessary.
* Github is software that at its core uses Git, but that is where the similarities end. Github allows users to track their changes, but also to share code, collaborate on projects and network. It also provides coders a way to share the level of their coding ability to prospective employers.
* Spend up to 30 minutes each day curating professional online presence with LinkedIn, Github and your WordPress blog. If you are unable to do all the tasks you want within the 30 minutes, then write down a task list and tackle them in the following days. Its about getting into the habit, not getting everything done in a day and forgetting about it thereafter.
